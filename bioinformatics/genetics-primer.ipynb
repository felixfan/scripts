    "\n",
    "The genotype for a single gene in a diploid organism often referred to as being either homozygous, heterozygous or hemizygous. These terms are a shorthand way of describing the genotypes.    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Homo means \"same or common\". Homozygous means that both alleles are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hetero  means \"different\".   Heterozygous means that the two alleles are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hemi means \"half\".   Hemizygous means that there is only one allele (instead of two) in a diploid cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is present in males for sex linked genes on X chromosome. Because males are XY, they have only one copy of X chromosome. So for all the genes present on X chromosomes for male, they have only one allele. So we can say only half of the alleles are present as compare to females with genotype XX. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hemizygous condition can also occur in autosomal chromosome under abnormal condition such as deletion or loss of chromosome where one of the autosomal allele is missing. So for that particular gene on autosomal chromosome it is called hemizygous.\n",

    "Since control of eye color is encoded by a gene on the X-chromosome, females (XX) carry two copies and males (XY) only carry one.
